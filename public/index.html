            <h2>Scenario One: Friend’s Face</h2>
            <img class="scen-img" src="">
            <p>Scenario:</p>
            <p>You find yourself at a party with a close friend of yours. It’s one of those parties where a friend of a friend invites their friends and by the time the event happens almost nobody knows the host and feels like they’re surrounded by strangers. But hey, there’s a nice spread (including a chocolate fountain), the music isn’t too bad, and let’s be real, you had nothing better to do on this particular Friday night. </p>
            <p>While you’re chatting with your friend you notice that they seemed to have splashed a small but noticeable amount of chocolate fondue on their forehead and they haven’t seemed to notice. What will you do?</p>
            <div class="answer-sec">
                <button id="an1A">A.	Cough, look them in the eye and gesture around your forehead.</button>

           <p>Scenario:</p>
           <p>You’ve just finished a shopping trip at the grocery store. As you load the last thing into your car and close the door, you look around and realize that you’re not even remotely close to the shopping cart stall, what do you do with your cart?</p>
           <div class="answer-sec">
               <button id="an2A">A.	Walk it to the stall.</button>

            <h2>Scenario Three: A Child's Pet</h2>
            <img class="scen-img" src="">
            <p>Scenario:</p>
            <p>Some time ago your kid (or niece/nephew, or little sibling) brought home a rabbit that they caught to keep as a pet. Unfortunately, since the kid is so young, you end up taking care of the creature even though you really didn’t want it and realistically you don’t have time for it. After some time, you decided that it’s time to get rid of the rabbit. What do you do?</p>
            <div class="answer-sec">
                <button id="an3A">A.	Tell the kid that the rabbit needs to go back to nature where it belongs.</button>
                <button id="an3B">B.	Discretely release the rabbit and tell the kid that it must have gotten out.</button>
            <button id="an3C">C.	Have “chicken soup” for dinner and tell the kid that the rabbit went to go live on a farm.</button>

        <h2>Scenario Four: OnlyFlans</h2>
        <img class="scen-img" src="">
        <p>Scenario:</p>
        <p>You find yourself at the head of a mid-size software engineering company. Your most recent client surprisingly is world famous baker Saul Bollywood. Together you’ve been working on an app called OnlyFlans wherein users can make online profiles and share recipes, videos, and images and monetize their content how they see fit. </p>
        <p>The app is new, and the team hasn’t really flushed out the terms of service. Unfortunately, some enterprising Twitch streamers have caught wind of this app and have started putting out content that’s—well—far spicier than any flan should be. This has led to an explosion in new users and subsequently, revenue. Mr. Bollywood for his part is not terribly thrilled about the new content as he was hoping to have something that he’d, “be able to show my nan without blushing”. The two of you are meeting in person tomorrow. What will you do?</p>
        <div class="answer-sec">
            <button id="an4A">A.	Update the terms of service to ban spicy content and risk loss of users and revenue (the “hot sauce enthusiasts” will probably leave).</button>
            <button id="an4B">B.	Update the terms of service to so that creators must put "spicy content" restrictions on their content.</button>
            <button button id="an4C">C.	Don’t update the Terms of service and try to persuade Mr. Bollywood that revenue from the new users is worth the change in—uh—flavor in the site.</button>

        <h2>Scenario Five: The Goat in the Thicket</h2>
        <img class="scen-img" src="">
        <p>Scenario:</p>
        <p>You find yourself hiking alone in the mountains. As you are walking along the trail you hear rustling and bleating. Your curiosity is piqued, you move towards the noise and find a mountain goat with its horns caught in a bush and unable to dislodge them. What will you do?</p>
        <div class="answer-sec">
            <button button id="an5A">A.	Help the goat.</button>

        <h2>Scenario Six: The Genie</h2>
        <img class="scen-img" src="">
        <p>Scenario:</p>
        <p>You’re walking along a beach and look down to see a lamp—the sort used in the middle east during the Middle Ages. Perhaps it’s the intricate design on the lamp or the fact that this looks like a missing prop from an Aladdin play, but it catches your eye, and you pick it up. You notice a smudge on the surface of the lamp and rub it. </p>
        <p>Poof! A man that looks like a member of the Blue Man Group and sounds suspiciously like Robin Williams appears in a burst of blue smoke. The man introduces himself as a genie and offers to grant you a single wish. You protest and highlight that granting three wishes is the norm, to which the genie cryptically responds, “not in this economy”. What will you wish for?</p>

                <h1>The Tranquil</h1>
                <img src="" class="results-cover">
                <h4>“I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.”</h4>
                <h4>--Michael Scott</h4>
                <h3>Profile Summary</h3>
                <p>The tranquil is one who has a profound calmness about life that is usually sustained by the sort of substances that will fail a drug test and/or not paying attention to the state of the world…at all. The tranquil is guided by the idea that most people would be happier if everyone just relaxed, took a load off, and…anyone else getting the munchies? </p>
                <p>Tranquil people tend to have an allure to simple pursuits, gardening, growing herbs, home decorating, baking, and escapist pursuits in the reading of books, playing of videogames, and taking trips (with or without chemical assistance). </p>
                <p>Tranquil people get along with almost everyone, except people with little to no chill. No matter what the tranquil does, non-chill people berate them with questions such as “why don’t you care”, “where did all my snacks go”, or “why don’t you get a job”.</p>

                <h1>The Fool</h1>
                <img src="" class="results-cover">
            <h4>“The only true wisdom is in knowing that you know nothing.”</h4>
            <h4>--Socrates</h4>
            <h3>Profile Summary</h3>
            <p>The fool is a noble character who recognizes that they don’t know much. Many of history’s great philosophical minds have generally agreed that recognizing one’s self as being a fool is the beginning of becoming a virtuous and noble person. Of course, that progression requires no small amount of humility and introspection and why should anyone be bothered with that?</p>
            <p>The fool in the modern era is content to listen to society’s experts and leaders blindly, because it is well understood that the foremost in society are not at all enticed by things like ego and self-interest at the expense of others. Furthermore, the fool understands that it is best to go with the flow even when it defies logic—come on now, it’s not as though a mass of people who have wholly outsourced their critical thinking could be easily manipulated. </p>
            <p>The fool generally gets along with most people, and their close attention to the relevant fads and mainstream opinions means that they are easy to talk to. Just don’t ask them to think for themselves, it hurts, and makes them feel self-conscious.</p>

        <div class="results" id="disconcert" hidden>
            <h1>The Disconcerted</h1>
            <img src="" class="results-cover">
            <h4>“Until the great mass of people shall be filled with the sense of responsibility for each other’s welfare, social justice can never be attained”</h4>
            <h4>--Helen Keller</h4>
            <h3>Profile Summary</h3>
            <p>The disconcerted is an individual who has been reliably informed about the by the most prominent authorities and figures in media and has taken upon themselves, the charge of remedying the wrongs of the world wherever the disconcerted finds them. You may be tempted to ask, has this person done any of their own research or dived into the data presented them, or really how qualified and capable are they to go on their social justice crusade? </p>
            <p>To the disconcerted, such questions are a waste of time when the pandas are set to die of extinction due to deforestation and a profound disinterest in breeding in zoos, and climate change is set to cause the world’s oceans to rise to levels that would engulf Los Angeles by the year 2012—I mean 2020—I mean 2030, or whatever deadline the experts put out next. </p>
            <p>No, the disconcerted will abandon their unkempt homes and sever ties with critical friends and even family members to make a cardboard sign and protest whatever the dire issue of the day is, because protesting and demanding others change instead of looking inward is really how societal change is brought about.</p>

        <div class="results" id="indiff" hidden>
            <h1>The Indifferent</h1>
            <img src="" class="results-cover">
            <h4>“The less I know abut other people’s affairs, the happier I am. I’m not interested in caring about other people. I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.”</h4>
            <h4>--Ron Swanson</h4>
            <h3>Profile Summary</h3>
            <p>The indifferent is something of an enigma. It’s not clear if indifferents are driven by an unparalleled self-interest, a passive nihilism, a profound exhaustion with the world around them, or some combination of all three. Most people when interacting with indifferents seem to think that they’re deeply depressed, when actually the indifferent lives in a quasi-nirvana state—an almost complete detachment from the pettiness of the world and the petty people in it.</p>
            <p>Indifferents struggle when presented with questions like, “what are your passions”, “don’t you care”, and “what do you mean you forgot it was my birthday”. Truthfully, indifferents do have a singular source of ire and distain, namely expectations from those around them. If everyone would just get off their backs, the indifferents would be much happier.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to get an indifferent to do anything they aren’t inclined to do, but on the plus side, their reticence around action means that they rarely act foolishly or act at all.</p>

        <div class="results" id="chad" hidden>
            <h1>The Chad</h1>
            <img src="" class="results-cover">
            <h4>“Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.”</h4>
            <h4>--Marcus Aurelius</h4>
            <h3>Profile Summary</h3>
            <p>The Chad is a well-rounded realist who takes things on a case-by-case basis. The Chad operates with a healthy amount of skepticism particularly around things that gin up a lot of public outrage. The Chad generally waits and assesses information before making any moves but moves decisively once the conclusion has been made.</p>
            <p>A universal of Chads is an adoption of the philosophy stoicism, which in brief is the belief that control of one’s self, particularly one’s emotions is paramount for living well. Chads also tend to believe that the path to making the world a better place begins on an individual level and from within.</p>
            <p>Your standard Chad recognizes that he doesn’t know everything and has an open mind to a certain degree. Chads generally like podcasts like the Joe Rogan experience, and other alternative takes on the world at large. It is for this reason that Chads usually do not get along with people who like to outsource their critical thinking to “approved” experts and authorities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="results" id="sadist" hidden>
            <h1>The Sadist</h1>
            <img src="" class="results-cover">
            <h4>“…some men aren’t looking for anything logical, like money. They can’t be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.”</h4>
            <h4>--Alfred Pennyworth</h4>
            <h3>Profile Summary</h3>
            <p>The Sadist is a person who delights in the suffering of others. Sadists usually aren’t without conscience and have limits on their indulgences, but they routinely test such limits and their consequences. Your typical sadist reacts to most arguments, disputes, and conflict generally by grabbing the nearest seat and some snacks if it’s at all possible.</p>
            <p>Truthfully, almost nobody is born a sadist; it’s a condition that develops in the wake of personal tragedy such as learning that Santa Clause isn’t real at the age of 14, or that a favorite pet did not in fact go to live on a farm in the countryside. What makes sadists redeemable is their propensity to choose to laugh instead of cry in the face of life’s low points, just so long as it isn’t at their own expense.</p>
            <p>Bored sadists are something of a liability. They usually won’t begin an argument but aren’t above enticing someone else to poke the proverbial bear and reveling in the ensuing aftermath. Skilled sadists can usually do this in a sentence or less.</p>

        <div class="results" id="mastermind" hidden>

            <h4>“Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.”</h4>
            <h4>--Emperor Palpatine</h4>
            <h3>Profile Summary</h3>
            <p>The Mastermind is the kind of person that is above average in intelligence, holds grudges, and is incredibly patient. Unlike the typical sadist or edge-lord that can’t help themselves when an opportunity to roast someone comes around, the mastermind will wait for the optimal vulnerability in a conversation or group chat to strike.</p>
            <p>Your typical mastermind is generally perceived as polite unassuming person, which makes their jabs the more surprising and impactful. Their unassuming nature also means that people will feel at ease around a mastermind and find themselves oversharing about their life. The mastermind generally doesn’t care for such information is being stored as ammunition for later. Masterminds generally aren’t idealists; they don’t want to change the world so much as get a vice-like grip on it.</p>

        <div class="results" id="savage" hidden>
            <h1>The Savage</h1>
            <img src="" class="results-cover">
            <h4>“I hope he didn’t die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor, then I hope he did die”</h4>
            <h4>--Bender Bending Rodriguez</h4>
            <h3>Profile Summary</h3>
            <p>The savage is the most brutal of realists and have no compunctions about articulating the reality in front of them regardless of the consequences. This willingness to accept life as it is without the rose-colored lenses of idealism makes savages unbelievably resilient and natural opportunists. When life gives the savage lemons, savages are generally torn between eating them raw or trying to squeeze them in life’s eyes.  </p>
            <p>Savages tend to have difficulties in social situations, particularly with new people who don’t appreciate their brutal honesty and the leveraging of every opportunity to roast people that is presented to them. Savages are pretty natural meme-smiths, unfortunately they lack a great filter for the nuance and politeness that govern in-person interactions, which either serves them well in their career, or horribly cripples them. Such is the law of the jungle.</p>

            <img  class="results-cover" src="https://i.imgflip.com/6azodu.jpg">
            <h4>"Deep down, you know that you deserve to be punished. Don't you, Mr. Potter?"</h4>
            <h4>--Dolores Umbridge</h4>
            <h3>Profile Summary</h3>
            <p>The Karen is a person who has a profound sense of self-confidence and recognition of their vital importance in whatever sphere of influence of they find themselves in. Which isn’t to say that they’re the most important person in the world (that would be conceded), but it is certain that they’re worthy of esteem and recognition, and you’re asking why is rather contemptable.</p>
            <p>Karens recognize the potency of their influence and esteem, and therefore seek to involve themselves in the lives of those around them. This is a tremendous act of self-sacrifice and should be regarded as such. Karens are humble and recognize they’re not the most eminent authority on all areas. After all one must concede to an expert in any given area, unless what they’re saying contradicts the Karen. In that case they’re nothing more than a rube and a charlatan. Who cares about their certifications and experience? Their opinion is contradictory, so it is wrong.</p>
            <p>Karens cannot abide people who selfishly want to chart their own course in life, or believe in nasty things like privacy, stoicism, and worst of all, rolling with the punches and not worrying at all about worries of the world that don’t affect them directly.  </p>
