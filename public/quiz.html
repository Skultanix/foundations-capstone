       <h2>Scenario One: Friend’s Face</h2>
       <img class="scen-img" src="">
       <p>Scenario:</p>
       <p>You find yourself at a party with a close friend of yours. It’s one of those parties where a friend of a friend invites their friends and by the time the event happens almost nobody knows the host and feels like they’re surrounded by strangers. But hey, there’s a nice spread (including a chocolate fountain), the music isn’t too bad, and let’s be real, you had nothing better to do on this particular Friday night. </p>
       <p>While you’re chatting with your friend you notice that they seemed to have splashed a small but noticeable amount of chocolate fondue on their forehead and they haven’t seemed to notice. What will you do?</p>
       <div class="answer-sec">
           <button>A.	Cough, look them in the eye and gesture around your forehead.</button>
           <button>B.	Tell them about the chocolate on their forehead.</button>
           <button>C.	Do nothing.</button>

    <h2>Scenario Two: The Shopping Cart</h2>
    <img class="scen-img" src="">
    <p>Scenario:</p>
    <p>You’ve just finished a shopping trip at the grocery store. As you load the last thing into your car and close the door, you look around and realize that you’re not even remotely close to the shopping cart stall, what do you do with your cart?</p>
    <div class="answer-sec">
        <button>A.	Walk it to the stall.</button>
        <button>B.	Hand it off to the nearest person headed toward the store.</button>

    <h2>Scenario Three: A Child's Pet</h2>
    <img class="scen-img" src="">
    <p>Scenario:</p>
    <p>Some time ago your kid (or niece/nephew, or little sibling) brought home a rabbit that they caught to keep as a pet. Unfortunately, since the kid is so young, you end up taking care of the creature even though you really didn’t want it and realistically you don’t have time for it. After some time, you decided that it’s time to get rid of the rabbit. What do you do?</p>
    <div class="answer-sec">
        <button>A.	Tell the kid that the rabbit needs to go back to nature where it belongs.</button>
        <button>B.	Discretely release the rabbit and tell the kid that it must have gotten out.</button>
        <button>C.	Have “chicken soup” for dinner and tell the kid that the rabbit went to go live on a farm.</button>

    <h2>Scenario Four: OnlyFlans</h2>
    <img class="scen-img" src="">
    <p>Scenario:</p>
    <p>You find yourself at the head of a mid-size software engineering company. Your most recent client surprisingly is world famous baker Saul Bollywood. Together you’ve been working on an app called OnlyFlans wherein users can make online profiles and share recipes, videos, and images and monetize their content how they see fit. </p>
    <p>The app is new, and the team hasn’t really flushed out the terms of service. Unfortunately, some enterprising Twitch streamers have caught wind of this app and have started putting out content that’s—well—far spicier than any flan should be. This has led to an explosion in new users and subsequently, revenue. Mr. Bollywood for his part is not terribly thrilled about the new content as he was hoping to have something that he’d, “be able to show my nan without blushing”. The two of you are meeting in person tomorrow. What will you do?</p>
    <div class="answer-sec">
        <button>A.	Update the terms of service to ban spicy content and risk loss of users and revenue (the “hot sauce enthusiasts” will probably leave).</button>
        <button>B.	Update the terms of service to so that creators must put "spicy content" restrictions on their content.</button>
        <button>C.	Don’t update the Terms of service and try to persuade Mr. Bollywood that revenue from the new users is worth the change in—uh—flavor in the site.</button>

    <h2>Scenario Five: The Goat in the Thicket</h2>
    <img class="scen-img" src="">
    <p>Scenario:</p>
    <p>You find yourself hiking alone in the mountains. As you are walking along the trail you hear rustling and bleating. Your curiosity is piqued, you move towards the noise and find a mountain goat with its horns caught in a bush and unable to dislodge them. What will you do?</p>
    <div class="answer-sec">
        <button>A.	Help the goat.</button>
        <button>B.	Leave the goat.</button>
        <button>C.	Throw a rock at the goat.</button>

    <h2>Scenario Six: The Genie</h2>
    <img class="scen-img" src="">
    <p>Scenario:</p>
    <p>You’re walking along a beach and look down to see a lamp—the sort used in the middle east during the Middle Ages. Perhaps it’s the intricate design on the lamp or the fact that this looks like a missing prop from an Aladdin play, but it catches your eye, and you pick it up. You notice a smudge on the surface of the lamp and rub it. </p>
    <p>Poof! A man that looks like a member of the Blue Man Group and sounds suspiciously like Robin Williams appears in a burst of blue smoke. The man introduces himself as a genie and offers to grant you a single wish. You protest and highlight that granting three wishes is the norm, to which the genie cryptically responds, “not in this economy”. What will you wish for?</p>
    <div class="answer-sec">
        <button>A.	World-Peace.</button>
        <button>B.	 Happiness.</button>
        <button>C.	Power.</button>
